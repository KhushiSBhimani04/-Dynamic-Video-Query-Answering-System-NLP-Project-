       "' There are more twins today than ever.

There are more living things on and inside\\nyour body than there are people on Earth. And not just twice or three times so — the\\nnumbers are simply mind-blowing. Speaking of which, bacteria make up from 2\\nto 9 pounds of your body weight. It’s hard to imagine how many of them there\\nare in your body. If you have a kid, be prepared for question\\nbombardment: an average four-year-old asks something over 400 times per day. There’s a chili pepper that you can’t\\neat if you want to stay alive. It’s never used in cooking, though: it was\\ndesigned as a painkiller. Scientists believe Leonardo da Vinci could\\nwrite with one hand and draw pictures with the other at the same time. Talk about multitasking! Your outer skin gets totally replaced each\\nmonth. Overall, an average human sheds about 40 pounds\\nof skin throughout their life. There’s a room in the Microsoft’s headquarters\\nin Washington that holds a world record for being the quietest room in the world. Standing inside it, you can hear your heart\\nbeating. In August 2010, Beijing witnessed the longest\\ntraffic jam ever: it lasted 10 days and was 62 mi long. The Metric system is the most widely accepted\\nsystem of measurement in the world. Only three countries still use the imperial\\nunits: Liberia, Myanmar, and the US. John D.

Starfish can not only regenerate their lost\\nlimbs, but even a limb can regenerate the whole starfish. Thanks to the Montreal Protocol, signed in\\n1987, scientists believe the Earth’s ozone layer will fully restore itself within half\\na century. Yay! In 2011, Forbes decided to estimate the net\\nworth of Scrooge McDuck. They came to a conclusion that it was $44.1\\nbillion. If taken together, all ants in the world will\\nweigh as much as the whole human population of the planet, and then some. Chicken are more than twice as numerous as\\nhumans. In 2009, their overall number in the world\\nwas estimated to be 18.6 billion. Purple is the least popular color when it\\ncomes to national flags. There are just two countries in the world\\nthat use it in theirs: Dominica and Nicaragua.
